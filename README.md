# Automated-Teller-Machine-RUST-

## Try It! :smiley: Automated Teller Machine with RUST
#### This simple RUST program shows the working process of an Automated Teller Machine!

To run this program, you will need RUST installed on your machine.
To check if you already have RUST on your machine, run `rustc --version` in your CLI or Terminal

If command does not output RUST version number, for Windows, go [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to download it and run the setup.exe. 
You will also need the _MSVC build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later._ To acquire the build tools, youâ€™ll need to _install Visual Studio 2022_ if you don't already have one. 
When asked which workloads to install, include:

#### Desktop Development with C++
#### The Windows 10 or 11 SDK
#### The English language pack component, along with any other language pack of your choosing

For MacOS or Linux users, run below command in Terminal to install RUST; `$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
`
This command downloads a script and starts the installation of the rustup tool.
After successful installation, you should see a message like this:

##### Rust is installed now. Great! #####

### Now that you have RUST up and running,
##### - Make a copy of this repo
##### - Enter the atm directory
##### - Compile and run the program with the command `cargo run`

:clap: Enjoy!!

#### Feel free to contribute to this project! :smile:
